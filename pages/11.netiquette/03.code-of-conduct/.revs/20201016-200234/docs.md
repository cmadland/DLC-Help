Below you will find some helpful guidelines that you can reference when interacting with other's online. While the anonymity of online activity can often feel like we have more latitude in our behaviour, then a face-to-face interaction, it is important to remember that there is somone else on the "other side" of our interaction - whether we intend to or not, our actions online affect's others. 

The topics below represent some common activities that you will be engaging in as a member of the TWU Learning Community. It is important to review to each topic to ensure we are conducting ourselves in a respectful manner that reflects the values of TWU and cultivates an environment of positive learning experiences.

  <summary><b>2. Email</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>Whether it be in your academic studies, or your professional career, exchanging emails is a common mode of communication with others – as such, it can also be a common source of miscommunication as people tend to rely on the same non-verbal cues that they use in face-to-face communication. Whether it is a simple question, or a more complex issue, it is best that you ALWAYS approach writing emails with a professional, academic choice of language and tone. Here are some guidelines to help:</p>
<p><b><i>Before Sending an Email:</i></b></p>
    <p><ul><li> Did you spend some time looking to see if your question was already addressed in a course outline? Discussion forum? Course site? Content?<li> If you are upset by something (such as a grade), have you taken a moment to reflect on your emotions? It is a good idea to take a few moments so that we are not writing something when we are upset…remember, once we send something, we can’t take it back!</ul></li></p>
<p><b><i>Composing an Email:</i></b></p>
    <p><ul><li> Always include a “Subject Line” that infers what your email is about. <ul><li> If you are emailing an instructor, it is best that you include a reference to the course you are enrolled in so the instructor does not have to “guess” – for example, in your subject line include “HKIN 100 - ….”</ul><li>Begin your email with the proper salutation (Mrs., Mr., Dr., etc…) – this establishes a professional, respectful tone. <li> Be mindful of other people’s time – your message should be respectful, but it should also be concise. Lengthy emails for simple matters discounts the value other’s place on their own time and resources.</ul></li></p>
<p><b>Note:</b><i>If you have a more complex matter, it might be better to use the email to set up a meeting or a phone call so that your concern can be given the time it deserves</i></p>
  <details>
  <summary><i>Things to Avoid in your Email</i></summary>
    <p><ul><li> Casual/Conversational Language – <i>an email IS NOT the same as texting!</i><li> A Rude Tone – Tone DOES NOT translate in an email – even if you intend something as a joke, it will not come across that way in an email. <ul><li> Always err on the side of professional and academic tones.</ul><li> Poor Grammar/Spelling – you are communicating in an academic and professional environment…invest time in proof-reading your message.<li> Misspelling people’s names.<li> Emojis.<li> Sarcasm.<li> Slang.<li> Using “unprofessional” fonts or colours – stick with Times New Roman or Arial (for example).<li> Using ALL CAPS – <i>it makes your email feel like you are yelling.</i></ul></li></p>
</details>
<p><b>Final Considerations</b></p>
<p>When using email, be sure to carefully consider:</p>
<p><ul><li> Is the content of this email intended for everyone? Or just one person?<ul><li> Be VERY careful using the “Reply All” function!</ul><li> Does this email include sensitive and confidential information? There is always the possibility that your words could be forwarded along without you knowing so be aware of what you put in writing.<li> What does your email address say about you? Are you using an institutional email (@twu.ca)? or a personal address (like gmail.com, or hotmail.com)?<ul><li> If you are using a personal address, is it professional in name? (Always remember this is a professional, academic environment).</ul></ul></li></p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> Be sure to be patient when waiting for a response. People, including your instructor, have other responsibilities and may not be able to reply right away. If a few days have passed with no response, it would then be a more appropriate time to send a respectful follow-up message. While it is possible that someone may have overlooked your message or forgotten to reply, it is best to operate on the assumption that they may have not had a chance to reply yet.</p>

  <summary><b>3. Online Discussion Forums</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>A discussion board is an academic environment - you are being graded in part on how you interact and communicate your ideas. Online discussion groups are most commonly used to develop critical thinking skills, foster innovation, and facilitate learning. To realize those benefits, everyone in the group must feel respected and safe. Spend time carefully thinking about content and tone before making your comments public - Remember that once you’ve pressed send on your comment, you can’t take it back. The following guidelines help to promote a positive experience for all:</p>
  <details>
  <summary><b>Be Considerate</b></summary>
    <p><ul><li> Read the whole discussion before adding a comment – this helps provide context.<li> Ensure your post is “on topic” and within the scope of the course content.<li> Be thorough while being clear and concise. <ul><li> Use full sentences as much as possible.</ul><li> Be credible – while differing viewpoints are important and help us learn, conspiracy theories are not.<ul><li> Ensure your ideas are supported by factual evidence.</ul><li> DO NOT repeat points that have already been made – you should focus on bringing something “new” to the discussion.<ul><li> Also avoid generic replies such as “I agree” – Discussion Forums are opportunities for you to not only learn, but also contribute to the learning of others.</ul></ul></li></p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Be Open</b></summary>
    <p><ul><li> Opinions WILL differ – this is the intention of a discussion board!<ul><li> Learning involves exposing ourselves to new ideas that challenge our thinking!</ul><li> Experiences of the other members of your learning group will bring new perspectives to your own understanding.<ul><li> Embrace new ideas as a positive thing – even if you disagree!</ul><li>	Approach critiques and feedback as constructive developments in your learning journey.<li> Recognize that diversity is important for our own personal growth.<ul><li> Be mindful that not everyone at TWU is Christian.</ul></ul></li></p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Be Respectful</b></summary>
    <p><ul><li> Express disagreement in a respectful, non-critical manner.<li> Do not attack or make personal, insulting remarks when opinions differ.<li> Be sure to explain idioms and Christian worldview statements - Not everyone at TWU is Christian or from a Canadian background. <ul><li><b>Be aware of how culture and language can influence meaning!</b></ul><li> Proof-read and edit before submitting (Academic Environment).<li> Control your temper!.<ul><li> Ideas that trigger an emotional response are GOOD because it is challenging something we believe to be true – reflect on this, DO NOT ACT ON IT!</ul></ul></li></p>
</details>
<p><b>Other Considerations:</b></p>
<p>Whether you are participating in a discussion as part of a course, part of a professional environment, or within your own personal pursuits, it is important to develop an awareness around matters of privacy. Some forums you will participate in will be more private than others – THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. Always remember, when we submit an online post, there is usually some public openness (word choice?) so it is important that we always carefully consider what we post. </p>
