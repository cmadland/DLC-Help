### Respect - Civility - Diversity - Opportunity - Inclusiveness

At TWU, it is expected that all community member's conduct themselves in a manner that positively reflects what we value as an institution: **Respect, Civility, Diversity, Opportunity,** and **Inclusiveness** (_Student Handbook Code of Conduct - Introduction_). It is important to remember that these values go beyond just face-to-face interactions and should be pursued, and practied, in all facets of our life - including within the domain of online communication. Before looking through the guidelines below, it is important to take a moment and consider that:

> Within the TWU community, students, faculty, and staff join together to pursue truth and excellence with grace and diligence, treat people and ideas with charity and respect, think critically and constructively about complex issues, and willingly respond to the worldâ€™s most profound needs and greatest opportunities. ~ _TWU Student Handbook_

Although the following pages will provide some guidelines for online conduct, ultimately, these values of TWU should be at the forefront of our interactions when engaging in online activity. In addition to the information contained in this Guide to Netiquette, it is expected that the Christian beliefs and practices, on which TWU is founded,  are consistently cultivated as we create an environment where everyone is treated with respect.
