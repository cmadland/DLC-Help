To learn how to create Groups, see the steps below.

#### Part 3: Creating "Groupings"

Once "Groups" have been created and students have been assigned, you have the further options of creating "Groupings."

A grouping is a collection of groups within a course. Using groupings allows you to direct tasks at one or more groups in your course, so that they can work together on the tasks.

In the group creation page, find the menu bar near the top of the page and click on the orange link that reads "Groupings."

Click the "Create grouping" button.
