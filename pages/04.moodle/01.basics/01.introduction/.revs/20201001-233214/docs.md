#### About
Moodle is a web platform that allows students and faculty to access a common, secure space to interact in the context of a particular course. Faculty are able to create or upload resources related to the course, distribute information about assignments and supplementary course materials, create and manage quizzes, and host conversations in the forums. Students are able to contact their faculty and each other, submit assignments, respond to discussion prompts, and complete quizzes.

Moodle is one component of TWU's Digital Learning Commons, which also includes [WordPress](https://create.twu.ca), [PressBooks](https://books.twu.ca), and other platforms maintained by individual faculty.


#### Login

2. Your current courses should be available under the `In progress` link. If you don't see them there, they may be on a separate page (click the navigation arrows to show more courses), or they may be under the `Future` tab.
3. Tap or click the course title to go to that course.
4. Students: if you don't see your course, there are a few reasons that may explain this, [which you can review here](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/basics/course-not-showing).
4. Faculty: if a course title is greyed out, the course is not visible to students. [Tap or click here for instructions to make your course visible.](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/show-hide).
   - All courses are hidden by default and must be made visible to students by adjusting the settings of the course.
