  <summary><b>Introduction and Login</b> - click to expand</summary>
  <p>
Moodle is a web platform that allows students and faculty to access a common, secure space to interact in the context of a particular course. Faculty are able to create or upload resources related to the course, distribute information about assignments and supplementary course materials, create and manage quizzes, and host conversations in the forums. Students are able to contact their faculty and each other, submit assignments, respond to discussion prompts, and complete quizzes.</p>
   <p>Moodle is one component of TWU's Digital Learning Commons, which also includes [WordPress](https://create.twu.ca), [PressBooks](https://books.twu.ca), and other platforms maintained by individual faculty.</p>
  <h4>Login</h4>
  <p>Go to [learn.twu.ca](https://learn.twu.ca) and enter your TWU email and password. You may notice that you are signed in automatically if you are already signed in to a different TWU system (Office365).</p>
    <p><mark>Every TWU student, staff, and faculty member has been assigned a ...@mytwu.ca (students) or ...@twu.ca (staff and faculty) email address. In <b>most</b> cases, your username is `firstname.lastname` and it is identical to the username you use to sign in to TWUPass.</mark></p>
    <p>!!!! To sign in to Moodle, your email will be as follows:<ul><li>!!!! - firstname.lastname@mytwu.ca if you are a student;<li>!!!! - firstname.lastname@twu.ca if you are staff or faculty.</li></p>

  <summary><b>Course Still Not Showing?</b> - click to expand</summary>
  <p>There are several reasons why your course might not be showing in Moodle.</p>

  <p><b>1. Your instructor has not set the course to 'Visible' yet.</b><ul><li>All courses are hidden by default.<li>Please see [this link for help with course visibility](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/show-hide).</ul></li></p>
<p><b>2. You are not properly registered for the course.</b><ul><li>Please contact the Office of the Registrar.</ul></li></p>
<p><b>3. You are not up-to-date on your tuition payments.</b><ul><li>Please contact the Office of the Registrar.<li>Once you are up-to-date, your status will be updated.</ul></li></p>
<p><b>4. You registered very recently and our system has not synchronized yet.</b><ul><li>We synchronize Moodle with Jenzabar \(our database of registrations\) every 6 hours.</ul></li></p>
<p><b>5. Your dashboard is only showing some of your courses.</b><ul><li>i) Scroll to the bottom of courses listed, scroll through other pages.<li>ii) Have a look through your 'Past', 'Future' 'In Progress' tabs.<li>iii) [Customize what you see on your Dashboard by following these instructions.](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/basics/filtered-course-list)</ul></li></p>
