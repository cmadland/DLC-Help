A system  like Moodle is not helpful if nobody knows how to use it, so we have created multiple resources for users to get what they need.

* If you can't find your answers here, [create a ticket.](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/Requests/ServiceCatalog?CategoryID=5436)
* Send an email to [elearning@twu.ca](mailto:elearning@twu.ca).
* Drop by the Extension office in NW during business hours and speak to one of our Academic Technology Ambassadors.
