### Introduction 

Chances are, most of your learning experiences, up until recently, have taken place in a traditional, teacher-directed classroom. As a student, in this model, you learn directly from an instructor who, most often, is the central figure from whom you take direction. In these type of classrooms, you might spend your time taking notes from an instructor's lecture, or memoring concepts in preparation for an exam. You also (for the most part!) have direct access during class time to ask questions of the instructor. Most of us are familiar with this model of learning so anything new, like online learning, can be daunting at first. 

Online courses are different - the instructor is no longer the central figure in a classroom. Instead, you (the student) become the central actor as you assume control for your own learning - this is sometimes referred to as _self-directed_ learning. In this model of learning, you work within a learning community made up of fellow students, online resources, and online communities that, ultimately, help lead you towards your learning goals. Your instructor is also part of this learning community, however, the know serve as a guide to help support your learning experiences. 

The following pages, in this section, provide some strategies to help you successfully navigate the new opportunities that online learning presents.
