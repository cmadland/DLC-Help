As you begin your study as an online learner, you will notice that some of the strategies that help support your success in a traditional face-to-face classroom might not be as useful in an online learning environment. On this page, you will find some strategies that support successful learning in an online course. Although each of us develop our own unique strategies when it comes to learning, the topics below reflect some common areas that can seem overwhelming, at first, in an online classroom.

  <summary><b>The Role of an Online Instructor</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>Although all of us have had experiences with teachers and instructors, the role of an instructor in an online environment looks slightly different then you may have experienced in a face-to-face setting. As we outline some roles that an online instructor will play, it is important that we take a moment to recall why a TWU education is so valued and revered. At TWU, great value is placed on creating an learning environment that focuses on inquiry so that student's graduate with meaningful experiences that place them at the forefront of their pursuits. As you read on, you will see that this objective continues to serve as a cornerstone in online learning environments - <i>even if it looks a little different then what you are used to!</i></p>
    <p><b><i>So what is the role of an online instructor?</i></b></p>
    <p>Your instructors at TWU have worked hard to design significant learning experiences that align with the objectives that make a TWU education so meaningful. Not only has your online instructor thoughtfully designed the content you will be exploring, but they will also serve as a teaching presence, and facilitator, through the duration of your course. Much like the experiences you had in a face-to-face classroom, your online instructor serves to support student learning in the online learning environment by answering questions and challenging assumptions as they help broaden your understanding of the world in which we live while also helping you develop the skills need to excel in your field of study.</p>

    <details>
        <summary><i>Teacher</i></summary>
    <p>In an online learning environment, your instructors take on the role like that of a teacher as they design the course. A primary role that they will provide is guiding you towards resources that will help cultivate your understanding of the subject matter. As you work through the course, you will notice that instructors will focus your attention on learning materials that are relevant, accurate, and meaningful based on their extensive experience in the field. Like any good teacher, your online instructor will work to ensure that these resources are provided with meaningful context so you have a sense of why it will be important to your own experiences in the field.</p>
</details>
        <details>
        <summary><i>Facilitator</i></summary>
    <p>Throughout your study, you will notice that your online instructors have included learning activities and assignments that are intended to challenge you in an manner that supports your intellectual and professional growth. As you work through the content of the course, take a moment to reflect upon why an instructor included these specific components in the course - think about how they might contribute to your understanding of the subject.</p>
</details>
     <details>
        <summary><i>Director</i></summary>
    <p>Just because you are learning in an online environment does not mean that your instructor will be unavailable. Just like your face-to-face experiences, all student's will have questions along the way - your instructor will be with you to answer those questions! Throughout the process of learning, you may find some areas are unclear, or you would like more clarity on a certain topic. Your instructor is a valuable resource who can provide guidance and direction so that you can resolve any issues that might arise.</p>
         <p>It is, however, important that you communicate effectively with your instructor. This might include asking specific questions or seeking out specific clarity as you take advantage of their role in your learning.</p>

  <summary><b>Time Management</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>Many student's enjoy online courses because they provide a great deal of flexibility compared to a face-to-face expereince. The nature of face-to-face learning requires to be in a certain class at a certain time - with online learning, we can engage in our course work at times that work with our personal schedules. This becomes a tremendous asset for those of us who need to balance work, family, and personal committments with the time needed to successfully complete our studies.</p>
    <p> A challenge for many online students, however, is that this requires effective time management skills. While a face-to-face class is more rigid in structure, it does offer a framework of organization: students know when they need to show up; where they need to show up; and, in large part, the responsibility is on the instructor to organize class time in an effective manner - as a student, you just have to show up and participate. As a student enrolled in an online course, you have much more flexibility in how you use your time, however, <i>YOU</i> are now responsible for organizing your time to ensure you are meeting the expectations of the course. This can be a struggle for many students. The first key to success, however, is being aware of this responsibility!<p>
    <p>Obviously, how you manage your time is a personal choice and, ultimately, you need to find a system that works for you. Some important factors to consider, however, are:</p>
    <p><ul><li>How many courses are you taking in a semester?<li>How many assignments will you have in each course?<li> Do you have any obligations to a group/team?<li> Has your instructor scheduled any required weekly meetings?<li> Are there labs attached to the course?<li> Are there discussions that you will need to participate in?<li> What other personal committments do you have outside of school?</ul></li></p>
    <p>Depending on the answers to these questions, it might be a good idea to develop a plan for the <b><i>semester</i></b>, <b><i>the week</i></b>, or <b><i>both.</b></i> If you identify some really busy weeks, you may even want to consider putting together a daily plan.</p>
    <p>Below are some tools you might want to consider using:</p>
    <details>
  <summary><b>Resources for Managing Time</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>Another benefit of technology is that there are many resources available to us to help us better manage time. Given how interconnected our world is, you can download certain apps on your computer, phone, and watch and link them together so you never forget! Most applications also include the ability to set alarms as a reminder - this might be a helpful feature if you have a particularly busy week ahead. Below are some common applications you might want consider experimenting with - keep in mind, however, the list of applications is nearly endless so you find one that works for you and try to use it consistently:</p>
    <p><ul><li> Google Calendar<li> Microsoft Outlook<li> Evernote<li> Trello<li> Wunderlist<li> A good, old fashioned calendar or agenda planner</ul></li></p>
    <p>As mentioned, this is not an exhaustive list but rather a starting point. Another option you might want to consider is your TWU email account - there is a built in calendar feature there that you can use to organize your time, and receive reminders.</p>
</details>
<p>As mentioned above, time management is an online course is an area that can often lead to feelings of being overwhelmed. While there is no "right" way to organize your time, it is strongly recommended that you work towards developing a system that works for you so that you can focus on successfully completing your course rather than on successfully managing your time.</p>

  <summary><b>Managing Information</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>One of the common issues that can cause stress for online learners is the overwhelming volume of information and resources made available to them in their courses. While technology is great in the sense that it allows us access to this vast wealth of information, it can also lead to a sense of feeling inundated because there is so much of it!</p>
    <p>In order to successfully manage all this information, it is critical that you develop a system for identifying, and organizing information that is important. In order to do this effectively, it is important that you learn how to identify the purpose of the resource. Some important questions that you can ask, in order to help with this are:</p>
    <p><ul><li>What do you need to learn from this reading?<li> Is it important to you professionally? Academically? Personally?<li> How did your instructor label it? <ul><li> Required?<li> Supplemental?<li> Of interest?</ul></ul></li></p>
    <p>The more streadlined we are in identifying the purpose of a resource, the better we are able to store it for future reference.</p>
    <p>One of the tools you will need to utilize in organizing all this information is an <b><i>information managment system</i></b>. These management systems can help you better organize information that you have identified as important, in a central location. Some examples that you might want to explore are:</p>
    <p><ul><li> OneNote<li> Google Drive<li> Evernote (more for taking notes)<li> OneDrive<li> Flash Drive</ul></li></p>
    <p>Once you have identified an information management system that works for you, take some time to explore the features that it offers to help you better organize your information. A good starting point is looking at how you can use <b>folders</b> to better organize your information. In addition, it is important to include a few notes as a reminder of <i>why</i> you found that information/resource important.</p>

  <summary><b>Teamwork in an Online Environment</b> - click to expand</summary>
    <p>Throughout your academic career, you have probably had experiences working as part of a group. As most of you probably discovered, group activities pose their own, unique challenges. As a student enrolled in an online course, you will soon discover that many instructors will continue to use <i>group projects</i> as a way to support student learning. Much like the challenges face-to-face teamwork presents, group work in an online environment can pose some unique challenges as well.</p>
    <p>While most instructors will have a system in place to help organize groups, it is important that your group establish a framework at your initial meeting to ensure you successfully complete your objectives. At your initial meeting, it is important that you address some of the following common concerns:</p>
    <p><ul><li> When is your next meeting? How frequently will you be meeting?<ul><li> Who is responsible for sending out the invite?</ul><li> What platform works for everyone in the group? <ul><li> For example, will you be using Zoom? Skype? Bluejeans? MS Teams?</ul><li> Between now, and the next meeting, how will group member's be communicating? <ul><li> Email? Text? Slack? </ul><li> Who will be responsible for what? <ul><li> For example, will someone be responsible for organizing all content? <li> or putting together shareable documents? </ul></ul></li></p>
    <p>Like all team projects you have had experience with, there are often still challenges with group dynamics and the fulfilment of responsibilities - this is no different in an online environment. It is important, however, to not let technology be the reason we do not meet our collective goals. Technology can be very powerful if used to its capacity but it does, however, require that we do some pre-planning with our other team members.<p>
    <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> When working as a member of a team in an online environment, it is important that everyone still follow the appropriate guidelines, and conventions, of netiquette. For more information, please reference the <b><i>NETIQUETTE</i></b> page.</p>
