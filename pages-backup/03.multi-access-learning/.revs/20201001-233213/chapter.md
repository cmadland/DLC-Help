We have prepared a number of resources for you to assist in completing your courses in the case that TWU campuses must close due to COVID-19.

Of primary interest to you, a faculty member who may be new to using digital technologies to connect with your students, are the sections called '[Multi-Access Learning](https://create.twu.ca/help/multi-access-learning)'; '[Online Learning On-Ramp](https://create.twu.ca/help/online-learning-on-ramp)', and some of the [Moodle](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle) resources.

Please know that it is normal to feel that you are out of your element and perhaps a little overwhelmed. We trust that through the materials posted here, you will see that it is possible to maintain high quality interaction with your learners, even if that interaction is mediated differently.

#### The best ways to get help are:
- [Create a ticket through the helpdesk](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/Requests/TicketRequests/TicketForm.aspx?ID=hRv7mA08DtA_)
- [Email elearning@twu.ca](mailto:elearning2twu.ca) This will create a ticket through the helpdesk.
- Call 604-888-7511 x3068 and leave a message. Messages are automatically forwarded to elearning@twu.ca and will create a ticket as above.

Please do not email a specific person directly. We need to be able to prioritize our tickets in a single location.

We are here to help!
