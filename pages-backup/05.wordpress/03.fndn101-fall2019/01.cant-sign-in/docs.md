If you haven't been able to sign in to WordPress because you haven't received a confirmation email...

- Make sure you registered with your '...@mytwu.ca' email address.  
  ! Students do not have email addresses that end with @twu.ca.
  - If you signed up with a different email address, try again with your mytwu.ca address.
- Check your Spam/Junk folder.
  - The confirmation email comes from 'Digital Learning Commons'

If you still don't have access, please email elearning@twu.ca and ask for your WordPress confirmation email to be resent.
