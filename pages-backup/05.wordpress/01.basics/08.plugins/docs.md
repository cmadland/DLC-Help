Plugins add extra functionality to your site. They come in a vast variety of forms such as sliders, PDF embedders, security enhancers, and more. Once activated, plugin settings can appear several places. Check to see if the plugin settings have been added to the Dashboard menu or under Settings on the Dashboard. More often than not they will be in those two places!
