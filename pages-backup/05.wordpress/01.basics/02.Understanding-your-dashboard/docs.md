The dashboard is the initial area you see when you log in to TWU Create. It's the center for your site management and where you create content. From the Dashboard you can navigate to content, settings, themes, plugins, and more.

When logged in to TWU Create, you will always have access to an admin menu visible on your sites. From the menu item that is the name of the blog (second from left), you can find the link to the dashboard. While in the dashboard, the same menu can be used to return to the front view of your site.
