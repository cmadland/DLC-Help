Your E-Portfolio site is built in [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and hosted for you by Trinity Western University. If you have never used this platform before or if you have experience with it, the information below will provide some basics on the features you will use the most.

Once you are logged in to the administration side of your E-Portfolio, each screen has a relevant set of tips and reference links available from the **Help** tab in the upper right.
