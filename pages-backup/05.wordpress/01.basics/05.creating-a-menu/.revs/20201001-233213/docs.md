Menus are the navigation on your site. The area where users can navigate to different pages, the search bar, a blog, etc. Menus can appear in different areas on a WordPress site. The placement can depend on what theme you choose. More often than not, the menu will appear somewhere towards the top of the screen as a horizontal bar. However, on a mobile device, a menu may appear as a hamburger icon in one of the top corners. A key takeaway about menus is that they need to be set again when you change your theme.
