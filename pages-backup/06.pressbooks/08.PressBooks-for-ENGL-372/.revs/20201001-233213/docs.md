## Getting Help
Don’t get frustrated, get help! Email Colin Madland, TWU’s online learning and instructional technologies expert, to get help with how to use PressBooks: [**colin.madland@twu.ca**](colin.madland@twu.ca). You can also make an appointment with him as a group, or individually, for some tutoring in using PressBooks. Please also feel free to email me, since I’ve gone through the experience of researching, writing, and setting up a page for Blake’s “The Lamb”: [**sara.pearson@twu.ca**](sara.pearson@twu.ca).
