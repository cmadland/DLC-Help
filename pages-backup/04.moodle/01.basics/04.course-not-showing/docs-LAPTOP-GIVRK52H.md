#### Why isn't my course showing in Moodle?

There are several reasons why your course might not be showing in Moodle.

* Your instructor has not set the course to 'Visible' yet.
  - All courses are hidden by default.
  - Please see [this link for help with course visibility](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/show-hide).
* You are not properly registered for the course.
  * Please contact the Office of the Registrar.
* You are not up-to-date on your tuition payments.
  * Please contact the Office of the Registrar.
  * Once you are up-to-date, your status will be updated.
* You registered very recently and our system has not synchronized yet.
  * We synchronize Moodle with Jenzabar \(our database of registrations\) every 6 hours.
* Your dashboard is only showing some of your courses.
