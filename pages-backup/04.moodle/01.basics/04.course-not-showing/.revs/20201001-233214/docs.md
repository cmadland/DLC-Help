#### Why isn't my course showing in Moodle?

There are several reasons why your course might not be showing in Moodle.

* Your instructor has not set the course to 'Visible' yet.
  - All courses are hidden by default.
  - Please see [this link for help with course visibility](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/show-hide).
* You are not properly registered for the course.
  * Please contact the [Office of the Registrar.](https://www.twu.ca/academics/office-registrar)
* You registered very recently and our system has not synchronized yet.
  * We synchronize Moodle with Jenzabar \(our database of registrations\) every 6 hours (6:00am, 12:00 noon, 6:00pm, and 12:00 midnight).
* Your dashboard is only showing some of your courses.
  1. Scroll to the bottom of courses listed, scroll through other pages
  2. Have a look through your 'Past', 'Future' 'In Progress' tabs.
  3. [Customize what you see on your Dashboard by following these instructions.](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/basics/filtered-course-list)
