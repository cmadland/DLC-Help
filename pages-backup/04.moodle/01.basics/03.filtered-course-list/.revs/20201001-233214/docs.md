#### Change the line that reads

`shortname | exp | My courses | (FA17)` to `shortname | exp | Fall 2020 | (FA20)` (in future semesters, use the abbreviation for the current semester)


!!!! Optional: Add a second line of code that reads `shortname | collapsed | Upcoming | (SP21)` to show your courses for the upcoming semester, but collapsed under a toggle.

#### Click 'Save changes'.
