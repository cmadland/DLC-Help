As of the summer 2019 semester, all new courses created in Moodle are hidden from students. This allows faculty opportunity to confirm course lists and revise the course as needed for the new semester.

The process of showing your course to students once you are ready is very simple.

### Click the 'Gear' and choose 'Edit settings'.

### Change the 'Course visibility' to 'Show'.
- also ensure that the `Course start date` and `Course end date` align with the current semester.
