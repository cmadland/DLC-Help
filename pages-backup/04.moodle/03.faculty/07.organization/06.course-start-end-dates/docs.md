- The start date will be set automatically to the first of the month prior to the beginning of class.
- As the instructor, you will have access to the course as soon as the course is created, about 6 weeks before the end of the previous semester.
- Courses are [now] set to be current for 120 days which will cover a full semester plus the exam period.
- Students can still access the course in the 'Past' tab on their Moodle Dashboard after the course has ended.
